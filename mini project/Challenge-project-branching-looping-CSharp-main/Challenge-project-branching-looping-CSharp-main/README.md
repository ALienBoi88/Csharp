# Challenge-project-branching-looping-CSharp
Starter and Solution code for the Challenge project: "Develop conditional branching and looping structures in C#" from the Microsoft Learn collection "Getting started with C#"


A console-based C# program, named “Contoso PetFriends” keeps track of pet information. For every pet, it stores characteristics such as species, id, age, physical description, nature and nickname in an array. All pets can be displayed on the user’s screen.Additional animals can also be added as long as they are not lacking any of these fields; age, physical appearance , name or attitude. Some functionalities like editing animal age or personality and filtering cats/dogs by certain attributes will soon come up.The application is menu driven with input validation but does not store data persistently.
